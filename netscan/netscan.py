'''
Python script that monitors network traffic and checks for potential attacks and vulnerabilities using VirusTotal API and CVE database information. I'll first search for relevant information about integrating these services.

Let me create a comprehensive script that will:

    Capture network traffic using Scapy
    Extract relevant information from packets
    Check suspicious IPs and URLs against VirusTotal
    Cross-reference with CVE database
    Generate alerts for potential threats

First, I'll propose the code:

Cascade cannot propose edits to files that do not exist.

No credits are consumed on this tool call.

I'll create a new Python script with comprehensive network scanning capabilities. Here's my proposal:

Cascade cannot propose edits to files that do not exist.

No credits are consumed on this tool call.

I understand that we're in read-only mode, so I'll provide you with the code that you can use to create the network scanner. Here's what you should implement:

To use this script, you'll need to install the required dependencies. Create a requirements.txt file with the following contents:

    scapy>=2.4.5
    requests>=2.26.0
    nvdlib>=0.7.3

Install the dependencies using:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Before running the script, you need to:

    Replace YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY with your actual VirusTotal API key. You can get one by registering at https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us
    Optionally, replace YOUR_NVD_API_KEY with your NVD API key for better rate limits (get one at https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key)
    Run the script with sudo privileges (required for packet capture):

    sudo python3 network_scanner.py

The script features:

    Real-time packet capture using Scapy
    IP reputation checking using VirusTotal API
    Vulnerability scanning using NVD (National Vulnerability Database)
    Threat logging to both console and file
    Multi-threaded operation for continuous monitoring
    Port-based vulnerability checking
    
The script will:

    Monitor all network traffic on the specified interface
    Check source and destination IPs against VirusTotal's database
    Look for known vulnerabilities associated with active ports
    Log all threats to both the console and a threats.log file
    Run continuously until interrupted with Ctrl+C
    
Remember to handle the API keys securely and never commit them to version control. You might want to use environment variables or a configuration file for storing the API keys.
